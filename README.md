# Article Manager Application

This will be an article manager application where you can manage your site's articles and users.

The current version of the application is on the **development** branch.
The frontend was setup for another backend (which has the same purpose as the backend here). I am working on to synchronize the frontend with the new backend.<br><br>

## Current Features
- User authentication, authorization
- Manage your own user profile
- Articles CRUD 
- Users CRUD
<br><br>

  - Bootstrap
